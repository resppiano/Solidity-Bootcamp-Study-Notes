# Solidity Class Study Notes

## Overview
This repository contains my personal study notes and practice materials from my Solidity programming course. These notes document my learning journey as I explore blockchain development and smart contract programming on the Ethereum platform.

## Contents
The enclosed files include:
- Lecture notes
- Code examples
- Assignment solutions
- Transaction analysis
- Smart contract deployment records
- Gas fee calculations
- Function execution results

## Purpose
These notes serve as my personal reference material and track my progress throughout the course. They demonstrate my understanding of key Solidity concepts including:
- Smart contract structure
- Function execution
- Gas optimization
- Transaction processing
- Blockchain interaction

## Note
These are personal study materials and may contain experimental code or works in progress. All contract interactions and transactions were performed in test environments.

## Usage
Feel free to review these materials, but please note they were created for my educational purposes and may not follow all best practices for production environments.
